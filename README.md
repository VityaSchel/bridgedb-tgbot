# BridgeDB Telegram Bot

Telegram bot that fetches bridges from BridgeDB with captcha, does the same thing as many other bots but it's mine and that's the only thing that matters.

⚠️ This version is specifically made for CGI server, not reverse proxy ⚠️

Uses node-fetch, ~LevelDB~ custom file-based db, and Telegram API through http requests.
